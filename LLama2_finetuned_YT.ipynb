The first GE crops were introduced in the 1990s. These crops have been designed to increase resistance to disease, herbicides, and drought. This has allowed crops to become resistant to disease that would normally wipe out the whole crop. These GE crops have also been engineered to produce insecticides and nutrients within the plant. In addition, the crops can have their size, color, and shape changed in order to increase the crop's value. (1) There are many advantages and disadvantages to the use of genetically modified organisms. Genetic engineering is the process of changing the genetic makeup of a living organism. It is used to produce new types of organisms in the laboratory. The advantages of genetic engineering are: • The use of genetic engineering is cost effective. It is much faster and more efficient to change a gene in a single organism then to cross pollinate and breed a new organism. • Genetic engineering helps scientists to learn more about how genes function. This could be a huge discovery in the future, and could be very useful in many ways. • Genetic engineering allows scientists to use the genetic traits......\\n...Genetically modified foods are foods derived from genetically modified organisms. Foods produced with genetically modified organisms are also referred to as GM foods. GM organisms are created using biotechnology and contain at least one gene from another organism. This gene can be from a different species, an organism of a different species, a different strain, or a different variety. GMOs were developed to improve a food by adding a new trait, but some foods were developed to make a food last longer. Genetically modified foods\"],\n",
